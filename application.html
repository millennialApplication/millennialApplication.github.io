            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>One of the things that I continue to struggle with about large corporations is the short-term focus they exhibit. Many businesses today look for short-term profits. This is a trend that has been spreading since the Reagan administration in the US. This kind of approach to gain the largest possible short-term returns is often at the expense of the long-term benefits to the shareholders.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With Fonterra, I saw something different. In addition to the benefits and opportunities associated with a large corporation, our profits support rural farmers rather than lining the pockets of the wealthy. This has the flow-on effect of supporting rural communities, which plays a big part in creating the New Zealand I know and love. I am continually motivated to contribute to this. The fact that we’re returning to a mantra of long-term value creation appeals to me, as I’m sure it appeals to farmers with their inter-generational values.&nbsp;</p></div>

Working collaboratively with my colleagues, we strive to create ongoing value for our farmers. As a co-op, we create goodness for generations of our customers. Providing them with high quality, nutritious products enables them to do and be more. This takes the circle of benefit from us, in Fonterra; our farmers, that we support; and extends it to the end users, that we enable.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There are two avenues where I believe that I can contribute to the implementation of the new strategy and purpose. During my normal day-to-day activities, I can work to empower others and create value. As a Millennial Council member, I would collaboratively work to show people the benefits of the new purpose, while identifying and mitigating barriers that stop them from realizing the full potential of our new purpose.</span></p><p><strong>Day-to-day Activities&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>One of my skills is thinking outside the box. Since I joined Fonterra, I identified that a reading group would be a great way to bring people from different backgrounds and experiences together with a common purpose. I set up the group with a focus of developing critical thinking and analysing different points of view. Having open contribution has led to eye-opening conversation. It’s incredible to listen to the different insights people take from reading books like The Black Swan (not the movie version), such as the viewpoint dilemma, where a farmer feeds his turkey, knowing what's going to happen on Thanksgiving, but the turkey expects life to continue blissfully forever. The thought then is how can we make sure that we're the farmer and not the turkey.&nbsp;Thinking outside the box has enabled me to convert a once-a-month lunch hour into a powerful and stimulating interaction with my colleagues. This is just one way that I would contribute through my daily activities to Fonterra's refreshed purpose. This is the type of endeavour that I’m motivated to be a part of.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Millennial Plan 
</strong></p><p>In addition to my daily activities, I believe a two-pronged approach is needed to provide long term benefits from the refreshed purpose – aimed at winning both the hearts and the minds of our people. The first prong would be a short-term information strategy, which is essential for informing people of where we are heading. I would also implement a long-term strategy designed to build trust, which would help us to fully recognize the potential of our new purpose. I believe that the second strategy requires a long-term approach in order for the organizational culture to achieve authentic change.</p><p>I would run my short-term informing process through direct reporting. I would utilize tools such as strategy emails and a Miles' video to outline the what the new purpose means, how it aligns with who we are, and the benefits we can see from embracing it. This last part is crucial. Neurochemistry and behavioural research indicate that people need to see the benefit of the new purpose for them to fully embrace it. Without meaning, company initiatives run the risk of becoming tick box exercises for annual reviews. Fonterra's purpose is powerful, and I believe it needs to be shared effectively to harness its full potential.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To unleash the full potential of our new purpose, we must identify current actions that don't align with our new goals. I believe this should be done in collaboration with our senior leaders. Once this has been accomplished, we have three options: we can alter our behaviour; alter our purpose; or we can treat this as a north star that we move towards over time. For example, I believe that the trust within the co-op could be positively impacted by assessing it in the light of our new purpose. If a lack of trust exists, it could undermine our purpose of “you, me, us, together”. &nbsp;</span></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>There have been a number of situations where I believe we can improve our level of trust. For example, if a team is heard saying that they don't want to be transparent and share their project status because they're afraid it could be used against them, this undermines the trust in an organization. In a healthy, trusting environment, Fonterra's work output should be produced in line with the company's financial and strategic targets. Unfortunately, employees are sometimes faced with the choice of doing what's in their own best interest or what's best for the co-op. One example of this is people’s behaviour with the EOFY rapidly approaching versus a strategy of trying to save as much EBIT as possible. I’ve observed teams trying to push projects through, in order to spend their budget. Many of these projects could be postponed or done internally, saving on consultant fees. This is a warning sign of a culture lacking trust that the co-op will take care of them if they put the co-op first in everything they do.&nbsp;</p><p>
</p><p>With an organization as large as ours, it will take time to build this trust. It starts at the top. But those at the top can’t create an environment of safety and trust for all those in the organization. Rooted in tribalism, psychology indicates that they can provide this feeling for no more than 150 people. However, they can make those close to them feel safe and trusted. Those people, in turn, can extend the circle of safety to those around them. In this way, the trust can continue to spread throughout the co-op.</p><p>
</p><p>This would be a big change for a slow-moving co-op. But I believe it to be the right thing to do. Therefore, I would collaborate with senior leaders and those around me to ask the questions, develop the plan, and make the changes. This top-down model of trust takes longer to build. However, it will be authentic and run deeper, becoming fully ingrained in our culture. Building this trust and co-operative spirit will allow us to build an environment where we are able to truly work you, me, us, together to generate goodness for generations to come.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>I believe the wider oCFO community has a massive part to play in developing and implementing both the short- and long-term strategy and purpose. The oCFO sits in a predominantly support role for many of the other parts of the business. We have an amazing opportunity to help implement the new strategy and purpose.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Our influence on implementing the strategy and purpose ranges from a high-level perspective through to the very granular. At the highest level, the strategy team sit at the core of continuing to flesh out the strategy. They play a key role in supporting the FMT to refine the strategy. We also have finance providing a financial framework to aid in decision making. At a more granular level, the Group Procurement team look after $6b in costs. Their decision making has a significant influence on EBIT. The DPAA team provide a deep dive into potential benefits and issues across the various parts of the co-op. There is also the GIS team, who’s synergistic collaboration with the rest of the co-op supports day-to-day operations, as well as having the possibility of improving efficiency and reducing costs going forward. While not directly responsible for producing our products, the oCFO has a critical part to play in the success or failure of the new strategy and purpose. 
</p><p>
</p><p>The broad range of my skillset and experiences provide an excellent foundation for the spectrum of work and potential topics covered in the LT agenda and ‘must win’ initiatives. I’ve spent time working with a successful high-tech firm, refining their business model and improving their processes. With a background in economics, management, and operations research, I have a strong theoretical underpinning for both high-level and in-depth analysis. I also have the people and communication skills to influence decision makers. When starting out my career as a hazardous area electrical engineer, I listened to the senior electrical engineer and hazardous zoning expert arguing for months about the right compliance systems and processes to implement. Taking positives and mitigating pitfalls from both points of view, I was able to present my ideas for an end-to-end redesign of the system and processes. They were both so happy with the idea that they put me in charge of implementing it. 
</p><p>
</p><p>As exemplified in the previous section, I believe my role as a member of the Millennial Council is to continue to think deeply about how our co-op operates and how it could be better. As a member of the council, I would be a part of a group taking a fresh look at problems, collaboratively bouncing ideas off each other, and fleshing out ideas into actionable plans to improve the co-op. This would involve asking the unconstrained mental questions, where we aren’t limited by the mental state of “this is how we’ve always done it.” We can ask “Why?”, which opens new alternatives to consider. In working with senior leaders, we can apply the Socratic method to test both the current business model and our fresh new ideas.  
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several questions that I’ve already been asking that tie into our new strategy. People have spent a considerable amount of time looking at how we can better utilize our milk. My question would then be, “How can we utilize our other resources?” Can we increase plant utilization by processing other products? These could be things like drying pea protein, kale or spinach powders. Could we use our bottling plants to bottle water when we aren’t bottling milk for extended periods of time? Looking at our DC’s, could we sale storage space for the periods when we won’t be utilizing all the space? Could Fonterra backload products for 3rd parties on paid-for train carriages, rather than being the largest shipper of air in New Zealand? All of these are tough questions, with unclear answers at this stage. However, by taking a fresh look at our options, we can potentially increase our EBIT and leverage our core business model to create additional benefit for our farmers.&nbsp;</p></div>
